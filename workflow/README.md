# Introduction

This directory contains Snakemake workflows and helper utilities.

## Local national labels

The [local_national_labels](./local_national_labels) workflow merges datasets from `data/raw_data` to produce `data/output/local_national_labels.csv`.

## Local news locations

`local_news_locations` (not yet implemented) will build a mapping between local outlets and the U.S. states they serve.
